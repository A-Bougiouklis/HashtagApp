As most of you know, I am not a native of this great state.
All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can.
And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go.
Let's recruit a new army of teachers, and give them better pay and more support in exchange for more accountability.
We can harness homegrown, alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuel-efficient cars.
But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own.
And most importantly for me, I discovered the story of my father's life, and the story of his father before him.
I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called "boy" by his employers for most of his life.
I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles.
In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation.
His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years.
In many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of Kenya, and indeed, the African continent as a whole.
Kenya, like many African nations did not come of age under the best historical circumstances.
This means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own nation more than 200 years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development.
As a result, many African nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies.
It's more than just history and outside influences that explain why Kenya lags behind.
Like many nations across this continent, where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable.
Among African nations, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability.
Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country.
The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.
And so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made.
And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe.
Of course, the best way to reduce bureaucracy and increase pay is to create more private sector jobs.
In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not.
When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups.
But there are so many others, some of whom I'm meeting during my visit here - Betty Murungi, Ken Njau, Jane Onyango, Maina Kiai, Milly Odhiombo, and Hussein Khalid.
And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together.
This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today.
In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve.
That she was born under the cloud of Jim Crow, free in theory but still enslaved in so many ways.
No more can we count on employers to provide health care and pensions and job training when their bottom-lines know no borders.
That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training.
Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in?
We entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage.
First, the Nunn-Lugar program should be more engaged in containing proliferation threats from Soviet-supplied, civilian research reactors throughout Russia and the Independent States.
Many of these aging research facilities have the largest, least secure quantities of highly enriched uranium in the world - the quickest way to a nuclear weapon.
In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.
My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.
By destroying these inventories, this is one place we could be making more of a difference.
One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort.
But thinking of the Russians more as partners does mean being more thoughtful, respectful, and consistent about what we say and what we do.
It means that the Russians can and should do more to support these programs.
And it means more sustained engagement, including more senior-level visits to Nunn-Lugar program sites.
But lately we haven't seen many of these visits.
We need to see more.
"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet.
Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less.
More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet.
How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans?
For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else.
We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma.
I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support.
And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability.
Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow.
And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money.
Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair.
But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.
When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights.
They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values.
I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work.
This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich.
The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things.
They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.
Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for.
Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend.
At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future.
making the hard choices and sacrifices necessary to uphold our most deeply held values and ideals.
the American people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ?
What is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the President to respond to Iraq’s reality by saying that he is “open to” or “interested in” new ideas while acting as if all that’s required is doing more of the same.
There is no reason to believe that more of the same will achieve these objectives in Iraq.
And, while some have proposed escalating this war by adding thousands of more troops, there is little reason to believe that this will achieve these results either.
It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding American forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own.
Moreover, without a coherent strategy or better cooperation from the Iraqis, we would only be putting more of our soldiers in the crossfire of a civil war.
No more coddling, no more equivocation.
By redeploying from Iraq to Afghanistan, we will answer NATO’s call for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism.
So far, Congress has given the Administration unprecedented flexibility in determining how to spend more than $20 billion dollars in Iraq.
Many who supported the original decision to go to war in Iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.
The first is that we should be more modest in our belief that we can impose democracy on a country through military force.
and most importantly, the prevention of these terrorist organizations from obtaining weapons of mass destruction -- will require the cooperation of many nations.
The National Intelligence Estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in Iraq than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.
But there are many others.
There have been too many speeches.
There have been too many excuses.
There have been too many flag-draped coffins, and there have been too many heartbroken families.
