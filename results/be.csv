It's humbling, but in my heart I know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this country can be.
In the face of war, you believe there can be peace.
In the face of despair, you believe there can be hope.
In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union.
But let me tell you how I came to be here.
I was a young man then, just a year out of college; I knew no one in Chicago, was without money or family connections.
I joined with pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings.
I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill.
It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith.
It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state Senator.
It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard.
It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst.
That's why we were able to reform a death penalty system that was broken.
That's why we were able to give health insurance to children in need.
That's why we made the tax system more fair and just for working families, and that's why we passed ethics reforms that the cynics said could never, ever be passed.
It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America.
But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change.
The genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed.
Each and every time, a new generation has risen up and done what's needed to be done.
It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans.
For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.
And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault.
I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate.
And it won't be easy.
Let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age.
And as our economy changes, let's be the generation that ensures our nation's workers are sharing in our prosperity.
Let's be the generation that ends poverty in America.
Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work.
Let's be the generation that finally tackles our health care crisis.
Let's be the generation that says right here, right now, that we will have universal health care in America by the end of the next president's first term.
Let's be the generation that finally frees America from the tyranny of oil.
Let's be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here.
Most of all, let's be the generation that never forgets what happened on that September day and confront the terrorists with everything we've got.
I thought it was a tragic mistake.
Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been.
Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace.
Let us be the generation that begins this work.
After all, every four years, candidates from both parties make similar promises, and I expect this year will be no different.
That is why this campaign can't only be about me.
It must be about us - it must be about what we can do together.
This campaign must be the occasion, the vehicle, of your hopes, and your dreams.
This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change.
As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through."
Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.
The first time I came to Kenya was in 1987.
I had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of Chicago, and was about to enroll in law school.
My sister, Auma, was teaching that year at this university, and so I came to stay with her for a month.
My experience then was very different than it has been on this trip.
Instead of a motorcade, we traveled in my sister's old VW Beetle, which even then was already ten years old.
But it was a magical trip.
I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called "boy" by his employers for most of his life.
I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles.
I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya.
And yet, I discovered that for all his education, my father's life ended up being filled with disappointments.
His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years.
And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well.
The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds.
But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.
In early 1960's, as Kenya was gaining its independence, its gross national product was not very different from that of South Korea.
It suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of national boundaries that were drawn without regard to the political and tribal alignments of indigenous peoples, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife.
Kenya was also forced to rapidly move from a highly agrarian to a more urban, industrialized nation.
When African nations were just gaining independence, industrialized nations had decades of experience building their domestic economies and navigating the international financial system.
As a result, many African nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies.
Other issues, such as resource extraction and the drain of human capital have also been major factors.
As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa.
It is being threatened by corruption.
My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections.
And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort.
Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive.
The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue.
This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising.
The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.
And so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made.
I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start.
And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe.
Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption.
In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not.
Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place.
When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups.
As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction.
And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be.
You will decide if your leaders will be held accountable, or if you will look the other way.
You will decide if the standards and the rules will be the same for everyone - regardless of ethnicity or of wealth.
As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young.
I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime.
I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can.
A seat had opened up, and some friends asked me if I'd be interested in running.
I went to bake sales and barber shops and if there were two guys standing on the corner I'd pull up and hand them literature.
And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya.
And the second thing people would ask me was, "You seem like a nice young man.
And all of this would have been unremarkable except for the fact that this woman, Marguerite Lewis, was born in 1899 and was 105 years old.
I've thought about the fact that when she was born, there weren't cars on the road, and no airplanes in the sky.
That she was born under the cloud of Jim Crow, free in theory but still enslaved in so many ways.
That she was born at a time for black folks when lynchings were not uncommon, but voting was.
She believed in this idea with all her heart and she saw this progress around her and she had faith that someday it would be her turn.
And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom.
And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused.
In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government.
Our faith has been shaken, but the people running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again.
That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams.
He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough?
Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders.
I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country.
And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country.
You know, we all remember that George Bush said in 2000 campaign that he was against nation-building.
We just didn't know he was talking about this one.
But in our past there has been another term for it - Social Darwinism - every man or women for him or herself.
It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps.
We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper.
So let it be said that we are the party of opportunity.
Let it be said that we are the party of affordable, accessible health care for all Americans.
Let it be said that we are the party of an energy independent America.
Let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that battles the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism wherever they may exist by matching the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy and the strength of our alliances.
And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win.
And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check.
If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda.
Because in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder Americans.
We're tired of being divided, tired of running into ideological walls and partisan roadblocks, tired of appeals to our worst instincts and greatest fears.
A while ago, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across America.
At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school.
The first was in hairstyling; the other in braiding.
When asked what was wrong, she said, "I don't want to take hairdressing.
Will all her childhood hopes be fulfilled?
And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose.
They can say that this was the time when America found its way.
They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again.
We were in Ukraine, visiting a pathogen laboratory in Kiev.
Inside, staring right at us, were rows upon rows of test tubes.
She picked them up, clanked them around, and we listened to the translator explain what she was saying.
Some of the tubes, he said, were filled with anthrax.
Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War.
But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater.
Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed.
And so the question we need to be asking ourselves today is, what is the future of this program?
With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come?
For my part, I would suggest three important elements that should be included in such a discussion.
First, the Nunn-Lugar program should be more engaged in containing proliferation threats from Soviet-supplied, civilian research reactors throughout Russia and the Independent States.
For a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating.
In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.
Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union was engaged in a massive undertaking in the field of germ warfare.
As one book says, "disease by the ton was its industry."
Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.S. troops.
Here in Washington, we saw what happened when just two letters filled with just a few grams of Anthrax were sent to the U.S. Senate.
Five postal employees were killed and the Senate office buildings were closed for months.
This was two letters.
For years, Nunn-Lugar programs have been effectively upgrading security at sites in six countries across the former Soviet Union.
And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.
We need to be sure that Nunn-Lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism threats.
Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures.
In Donetsk, I stood among piles of conventional weapons that were slowly being dismantled.
By destroying these inventories, this is one place we could be making more of a difference.
Outstanding career officials who run the Nunn-Lugar program -- people like Col. Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S. interests are protected.
I also saw their ability to ensure that shortcomings were addressed and programs were implemented correctly.
But thinking of the Russians more as partners does mean being more thoughtful, respectful, and consistent about what we say and what we do.
It will be difficult.
And it will be dangerous.
"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet.
Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to.
Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive.
We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more.
Now let there be no doubt.
Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time?
The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent.
And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made.
We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.
Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.
In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships.
And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman.
I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine.
Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them.
And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced.
Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education.
If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves.
For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face.
And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.
The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag.
America, our work will not be easy.
For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits.
What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose.
The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.
And that's to be expected.
If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know.
What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me.
It's been about you.
I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming.
They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred.
That together, our dreams can be one.
Not with so much work to be done.
Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom.
This was true for those who went to Lexington and Concord.
It was true for those who lie buried at Gettysburg.
It was true for those who built democracy’s arsenal to vanquish fascism, and who then built a series of alliances and a world order that would ultimately defeat communism.
And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal ?
In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people ?
Americans were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism.
Neither turned out to be true.
a conflict that has only increased the terrorist threat it was supposed to help contain.
Iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before American troops arrived.
This kind of realism has been missing since the very conception of this war, and it is what led me to publicly oppose it in 2002.
The notion that Iraq would quickly and easily become a bulwark of flourishing democracy in the Middle East was not a plan for victory, but an ideological fantasy.
I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a war in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.
Month after month, and then year after year, I’ve watched with a heavy heart as my deepest suspicions about this war’s conception have been confirmed and exacerbated in its disastrous implementation.
We have been assured that the insurgency is in its last throes.
We have been told that progress is just around the corner, and that when the Iraqis stand up, we will be able to stand down.
Senators, Republican and Democrat, including myself, had also voted in favor of a resolution demanding that 2006 be a year of significant transition in Iraq.
A year that is ending with an attempt by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group to determine what can be done about a country that is quickly spiraling out of control.
300,000 Iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet American troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier.
But it will not be easy.
Rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in Iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security.
The American people have been extraordinarily resolved.
money that could have been devoted to strengthening our homeland security and our competitive standing as a nation.
No, it has not been a failure of resolve that has led us to this chaos, but a failure of strategy ?
It may be politically advantageous for the President to simply define victory as staying and defeat as leaving, but it prevents a serious conversation about the realistic objectives we can still achieve in Iraq.
namely, preventing Iraq from becoming what Afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the Middle East, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home.
Moreover, without a coherent strategy or better cooperation from the Iraqis, we would only be putting more of our soldiers in the crossfire of a civil war.
The American soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.
And all the troops in the world won’t be able to force Shia, Sunni, and Kurd to sit down at a table, resolve their differences, and forge a lasting peace.
that it will be up to them to form a viable government that can effectively run and secure Iraq.
Let me be more specific.
When possible, this should be done in consultation with the Iraqi government ?
I am not suggesting that this timetable be overly-rigid.
We cannot compromise the safety of our troops, and we should be willing to adjust to realities on the ground.
The redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in Iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels.
Moreover, it could be suspended if at any point U.S. commanders believe that a further reduction would put American troops in danger.
Perhaps most importantly, some of these troops could be redeployed to Afghanistan, where our lack of focus and commitment of resources has led to an increasing deterioration of the security situation there.
As a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the U.S. troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.
But only if U.S. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among Iraqi factions; if the Iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the Iraqi government asked us ?
We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in Iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the Iraqi state and further polarization of Iraqi society.
The second part of our strategy should be to couple this phased redeployment with a more effective plan that puts the Iraqi security forces in the lead, intensifies and focuses our efforts to train those forces, and expands the numbers of our personnel ?
The security forces have to be far more inclusive ?
The third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in Iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement.
We need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put Iraqis to work and help our troops stabilize key areas.
The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution.
Many who supported the original decision to go to war in Iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.
But I have long believed it has also been a failure of conception ?
that the rationale behind the war itself was misguided.
And so going forward, I believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century.
The first is that we should be more modest in our belief that we can impose democracy on a country through military force.
In the past, it has been movements for freedom from within tyrannical regimes that have led to flourishing democracies; movements that continue today.
But even as we provide such help, we should be clear that the institutions of democracy ?
cannot be built overnight, and they cannot be built at the end of a barrel of a gun.
Much has been written about how the military invasion of Iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell.
threats we haven’t paid nearly enough attention to because we have been distracted in Iraq.
In my travels to Africa, I have seen weak governments and broken societies that can be exploited by al Qaeda.
According to a Pew survey, 42% of Americans now agree with the statement that the U.S. should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.”
We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.
I spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about Iraq that was similar to the one I did today.
There have been too many speeches.
There have been too many excuses.
There have been too many flag-draped coffins, and there have been too many heartbroken families.
And it is time to refocus America’s efforts on the wider struggle yet to be won.
