As most of you know, I am not a native of this great state.
What's stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans.
And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go.
But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq.
Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace.
Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most.
It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not.
By ourselves, this change will not happen.
Not just to hold an office, but to gather with you to transform a nation.
I slept on the couch of my sister's apartment, not a fancy hotel, and often took my meals at a small tea-house in downtown Nairobi.
The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds.
But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.
In early 1960's, as Kenya was gaining its independence, its gross national product was not very different from that of South Korea.
Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families.
Kenya, like many African nations did not come of age under the best historical circumstances.
It cannot wait for other nations to act first.
The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if Kenya does not act, it will fall behind.
Corruption is not a new problem.
It's not just a Kenyan problem, or an African problem.
It stacks the deck so high against entrepreneurs that they cannot get their job-creating ideas off the ground.
Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive.
In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost.
But elections are not enough.
We know that the temptation to take a bribe is greater when you're not making enough on the job.
In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not.
Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place.
When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups.
As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young.
I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime.
That she was born at a time for black folks when lynchings were not uncommon, but voting was.
Well it's time we finally said we notice, and we care, and we're not gonna settle anymore.
And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about.
The party that's not bought and paid for by the oil companies.
If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda.
I did not need sewing either.
We entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage.
Not to mention the environmental and public health and safety catastrophe that could come from a failure to store and transport these materials safely and securely.
While they are often difficult to use, they are easy to transport, hard to detect, and, as we saw in Kiev, not always well secured.
But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started.
This does not mean that we should ease up one bit on issues affecting our national security.
It's important for senior officials to go and visit these sites, to check their progress and shortcomings; to see what's working and what's not.
"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet.
These challenges are not all of government's making.
I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change.
These are not whiners.
How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans?
It's not because John McCain doesn't care.
We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work.
Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.
Our government should work for us, not against us.
It should help us, not hurt us.
It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work.
Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution.
Not even close.
America, now is not the time for small plans.
And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance.
But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.
That's not the judgment we need.
We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past.
If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need.
But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.
Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.
They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America.
America, our work will not be easy.
We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country.
I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office.
This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich.
We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong.
Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.
Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend.
"We cannot walk alone," the preacher cried.
We cannot turn back."
America, we cannot turn back.
Not with so much work to be done.
Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for.
Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save.
Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend.
America, we cannot turn back.
We cannot walk alone.
The notion that Iraq would quickly and easily become a bulwark of flourishing democracy in the Middle East was not a plan for victory, but an ideological fantasy.
I said then and believe now that Saddam Hussein was a ruthless dictator who craved weapons of mass destruction but posed no imminent threat to the United States; that a war in Iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al Qaeda and finish the job in Afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.
No matter how bad it gets, we are told to wait, and not ask questions.
A year in which well-respected Republicans like John Warner, former Administration officials like Colin Powell, generals who have served in Iraq, and intelligence experts have all said that what we are doing is not working.
300,000 Iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet American troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier.
The addition of 4,000 American troops in Baghdad has not succeeded in securing that increasingly perilous city.
Prime Minister Maliki is not making our job easier.
But it will not be easy.
There are no options that do not carry significant risks.
And so the question is not whether there is some magic formula for success, or guarantee against failure, in Iraq.
What is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the President to respond to Iraq’s reality by saying that he is “open to” or “interested in” new ideas while acting as if all that’s required is doing more of the same.
It is not enough for him to simply lay out benchmarks for progress with no consequences attached for failing to meet them.
And it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of American resolve.
No, it has not been a failure of resolve that has led us to this chaos, but a failure of strategy ?
It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding American forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own.
Our troops can help suppress the violence, but they cannot solve its root causes.
For only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the Iraqi factions that the U.S. is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ?
but it should not depend on Iraqi approval.
I am not suggesting that this timetable be overly-rigid.
We cannot compromise the safety of our troops, and we should be willing to adjust to realities on the ground.
This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.
We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in Iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the Iraqi state and further polarization of Iraqi society.
We can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the Iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government.
It is simply not productive for us not to engage in discussions with Iran and Syria on an issue of such fundamental importance to all of us.
cannot be built overnight, and they cannot be built at the end of a barrel of a gun.
do not just come from deposing a tyrant and handing out ballots; they are only realized once the personal and material security of a people is ensured as well.
The second lesson is that in any conflict, it is not enough to simply plan for war; you must also plan for success.
According to a Pew survey, 42% of Americans now agree with the statement that the U.S. should "mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.”
We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.
