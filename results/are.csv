Today we are called once more - and it is time for our generation to answer that call.
It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided, North and South, slave and free.
All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can.
For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.
And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault.
And as our economy changes, let's be the generation that ensures our nation's workers are sharing in our prosperity.
I know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things.
Divided, we are bound to fail.
That beneath all the differences of race and region, faith and station, we are one people.
Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families.
Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive.
The good news is that there are already signs of progress here.
But elections are not enough.
The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels.
I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start.
And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe.
So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials.
And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests.
In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not.
When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups.
The Kenyan people are the ultimate guardians against abuses.
The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened Kenya.
But there are so many others, some of whom I'm meeting during my visit here - Betty Murungi, Ken Njau, Jane Onyango, Maina Kiai, Milly Odhiombo, and Hussein Khalid.
And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be.
These are Americans who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do.
These are Americans who still dream big dreams -they just sense their leaders have forgotten how.
Who said we're going to keep on dreaming, and we're going to keep on building, and we're going to keep on marching, and we're going to keep on working because that's who we are.
Our faith has been shaken, but the people running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again.
The idea that some problems are just too big to handle, and if you just ignore them, sooner or later, they'll go away.
I don't think this administration is full of stupid people - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there.
But we also know that there are some things we can't do on our own.
We know that there are some things we do better together.
We know who we are.
So let it be said that we are the party of opportunity.
That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training.
Let it be said that we are the party of affordable, accessible health care for all Americans.
Let it be said that we are the party of an energy independent America.
And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win.
And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check.
Because in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder Americans.
Americans everywhere are desperate for leadership.
They are longing for direction.
We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew.
And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose.
Right now, rogue states and despotic regimes are looking to begin or accelerate their own nuclear programs.
And as we speak, members of Al Qaeda and other terrorists organizations are aggressively pursuing weapons of mass destruction, which they would use without hesitation.
Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed.
In the years ahead, this should become an increasing priority for the Nunn-Lugar program, the Congress, and the Russians, who are already taking important steps to help implement these programs.
While they are often difficult to use, they are easy to transport, hard to detect, and, as we saw in Kiev, not always well secured.
But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat.
Right now, there are forces within the former Soviet Union and elsewhere that want these non-proliferation programs to stop.
Outstanding career officials who run the Nunn-Lugar program -- people like Col. Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S. interests are protected.
And we are all mortal.''
Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less.
More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet.
These challenges are not all of government's making.
America, we are better than these last eight years.
We are a better country than this.
We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.
And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight.
He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong.
And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
These are not whiners.
These are the Americans that I know.
The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.
These are my heroes.
Theirs are the stories that shaped me.
That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper.
I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America.
Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education.
And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most.
Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations.
We are the party of Roosevelt.
We are the party of Kennedy.
The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.
And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future.
These are the policies I will pursue.
The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook.
I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination.
I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk.
Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores.
They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment ?
And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the American people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.
These are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, Americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in Iraq ?
No matter how bad it gets, we are told to wait, and not ask questions.
A year in which well-respected Republicans like John Warner, former Administration officials like Colin Powell, generals who have served in Iraq, and intelligence experts have all said that what we are doing is not working.
For the fact is that there are no good options left in this war.
There are no options that do not carry significant risks.
Rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in Iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security.
Dreams of democracy and hopes for a perfect government are now just that ?
We must instead turn our focus to those concrete objectives that are possible to attain ?
It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding American forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own.
They are doing so today.
To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in Iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.
Instead of consolidating the gains made by the Karzai government, we are backsliding towards chaos.
who are deployed with Iraqi as units advisers.
if the Iranians and Syrians think they can use Iraq as another Afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack Israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken.
And so going forward, I believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century.
do not just come from deposing a tyrant and handing out ballots; they are only realized once the personal and material security of a people is ensured as well.
But there are many others.
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs recently said that if a conflict arose in North Korea, we’d have to largely rely on the Navy and Air Force to take care of it, since the Army and Marines are engaged elsewhere.
