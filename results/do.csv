It's humbling, but in my heart I know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this country can be.
Each and every time, a new generation has risen up and done what's needed to be done.
For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight.
Let's do this.
Let's be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here.
I know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things.
It must be about us - it must be about what we can do together.
It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not.
Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.
And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well.
Kenya, like many African nations did not come of age under the best historical circumstances.
It never did, and it never will."
And, I will do my part to shape an intelligent foreign policy that promotes peace and prosperity.
But, Kenya must do its part.
Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive.
In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost.
And so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made.
I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start.
Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place.
As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction.
I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see.
As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young.
These are Americans who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do.
Well, I thought about it, and then I did what every wise man does when faced with a difficult decision: I prayed, and I asked my wife.
And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen.
That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives.
And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom.
She believed that we don't have to settle for equality for some or opportunity for the lucky or freedom for the few.
He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough?
I don't know about you, but I think old Newt is onto something here.
I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills.
And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country.
We just didn't know he was talking about this one.
Now, let me say this - I don't think that George Bush is a bad man.
I don't think this administration is full of stupid people - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there.
It's that it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do.
The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem.
It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps.
We know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to.
But we also know that there are some things we can't do on our own.
We know that there are some things we do better together.
Don't let anyone tell you we don't know what we stand for and don't doubt it yourselves.
And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win.
If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda.
When asked what was wrong, she said, "I don't want to take hairdressing.
I did not need sewing either.
I don't need to sew to go to college.
We entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage.
He looked at me and said, "Been there, done that."
Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War.
Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this.
With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come?
In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.
But thinking of the Russians more as partners does mean being more thoughtful, respectful, and consistent about what we say and what we do.
It means that the Russians can and should do more to support these programs.
I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change.
Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans.
How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement?
Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots.
I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine.
Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology.
Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class.
And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance.
If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves.
Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow.
But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy.
Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient.
But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need.
You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq.
You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington.
So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country.
Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe.
But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes.
I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain.
The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.
Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.
Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters.
If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.
I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington.
What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me.
In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did.
Not with so much work to be done.
And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal ?
A year in which well-respected Republicans like John Warner, former Administration officials like Colin Powell, generals who have served in Iraq, and intelligence experts have all said that what we are doing is not working.
A year that is ending with an attempt by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group to determine what can be done about a country that is quickly spiraling out of control.
There are no options that do not carry significant risks.
What is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the President to respond to Iraq’s reality by saying that he is “open to” or “interested in” new ideas while acting as if all that’s required is doing more of the same.
It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding American forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own.
They are doing so today.
When possible, this should be done in consultation with the Iraqi government ?
We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in Iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the Iraqi state and further polarization of Iraqi society.
Today, the Iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi people or stabilize the country.
do not just come from deposing a tyrant and handing out ballots; they are only realized once the personal and material security of a people is ensured as well.
But we should know that our success in doing so is enhanced by engaging our allies so that we receive the crucial diplomatic, military, intelligence, and financial support that can lighten our load and add legitimacy to our actions.
I spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about Iraq that was similar to the one I did today.
