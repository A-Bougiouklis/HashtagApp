But a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organizer for $13,000 a year.
I joined with pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings.
It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith.
I know I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington.
Each and every time, a new generation has risen up and done what's needed to be done.
He had his doubts.
He had his defeats.
He had his setbacks.
It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans.
And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void.
But Washington has a long way to go.
That's why we'll have to set priorities.
We'll have to make hard choices.
Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice.
Let's protect the hard-earned benefits their companies have promised.
Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work.
Let's be the generation that says right here, right now, that we will have universal health care in America by the end of the next president's first term.
Politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our country safe.
Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been.
That's why I have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by March of 2008.
Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most.
This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change.
I had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of Chicago, and was about to enroll in law school.
My experience then was very different than it has been on this trip.
When it broke down in front of Uhuru Park, we had to push until some joakalis came to fix it by the side of the road.
I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called "boy" by his employers for most of his life.
I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles.
I learned how my father had grown up in a tiny village called Alego, near Siaya, during this period of tumult.
I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya.
In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation.
And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well.
But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.
When African nations were just gaining independence, industrialized nations had decades of experience building their domestic economies and navigating the international financial system.
As a result, many African nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies.
This lack of access for Africa's agriculture and commodities has restricted an important engine of economic growth.
Other issues, such as resource extraction and the drain of human capital have also been major factors.
As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa.
There is no doubt that what Kenyans have accomplished with this independence is both impressive and inspiring.
Among African nations, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability.
You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability.
It's a human problem, and it has existed in some form in almost every society.
My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections.
In just the last year, our own U.S. Congress has seen a representative resign after taking bribes, and several others fall under investigation for using their public office for private gain.
But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve.
I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of Kenyans still live in poverty.
Corruption has a way of magnifying the very worst twists of fate.
Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive.
The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue.
I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start.
Finally, ethnic-based tribal politics has to stop.
Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see.
The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened Kenya.
As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction.
Looking out at this crowd of young people, I have faith that you will fight this fight too.
Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country.
As our parents' children, we have the opportunity to learn from these mistakes and disappointments.
We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great nations towards a better future.
These are Americans who still dream big dreams -they just sense their leaders have forgotten how.
A seat had opened up, and some friends asked me if I'd be interested in running.
And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya.
That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives.
We had held a large rally the night before in the Southside of Chicago, which is where I live.
And all of this would have been unremarkable except for the fact that this woman, Marguerite Lewis, was born in 1899 and was 105 years old.
And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life.
I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus.
She believed in this idea with all her heart and she saw this progress around her and she had faith that someday it would be her turn.
She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America.
She believed that we don't have to settle for equality for some or opportunity for the lucky or freedom for the few.
And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused.
In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government.
The sweeping changes brought by revolutions in technology have torn down walls between business and government and people and places all over the globe.
The world has changed.
But while the world has changed around us, too often our government has stood still.
Our faith has been shaken, but the people running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again.
That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base.
He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough?
Because I think we've all had enough.
Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders.
I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills.
I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country.
I've had enough of that.
I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia.
I've had enough of our kids going to schools where the rats outnumber the computers.
I've had enough of Katrina survivors living out of their cars and begging FEMA for trailers.
And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country.
The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem.
But in our past there has been another term for it - Social Darwinism - every man or women for him or herself.
It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps.
Yes, our greatness as a nation has depended on individual initiative, on a belief in the free market.
But it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, of mutual responsibility.
The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity.
That we have individual responsibility, but we also have collective responsibility to each other.
And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about.
And in the end, we know that it isn't enough to just say that you've had enough.
And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see?
We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew.
Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War.
But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater.
Everyone has a role to play, and everyone must accelerate this involvement.
The Department of Energy and others have certainly made progress in converting civilian reactors to low-enriched uranium, taking back spent fuel, and closing unnecessary facilities.
Many of these aging research facilities have the largest, least secure quantities of highly enriched uranium in the world - the quickest way to a nuclear weapon.
For years, Nunn-Lugar programs have been effectively upgrading security at sites in six countries across the former Soviet Union.
Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures.
While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons.
Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship.
But lately we haven't seen many of these visits.
It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well.
We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more.
More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet.
More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach.
This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news.
The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect.
But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time.
Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time?
The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent.
He said that our economy has made "great progress" under this President.
Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots.
You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.
We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush.
We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work.
The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight.
When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed.
She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life.
She poured everything she had into me.
I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine.
It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect.
Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them.
And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance.
If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums.
Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent.
And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons.
If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have.
When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights.
And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war.
The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy.
Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism.
So let us agree that patriotism has no party.
The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag.
They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America.
For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits.
What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose.
And that's what we have to restore.
Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters.
If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.
Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government.
If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know.
I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington.
What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me.
For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past.
You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington.
This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich.
We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong.
It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot.
Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom.
And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal ?
In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people ?
And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the American people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.
the American people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ?
a conflict that has only increased the terrorist threat it was supposed to help contain.
2,867 Americans have now died in this war.
Thousands more have suffered wounds that will last a lifetime.
The conflict has left us distracted from containing the world’s growing threats ?
And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the war in Iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on America.
This kind of realism has been missing since the very conception of this war, and it is what led me to publicly oppose it in 2002.
Month after month, and then year after year, I’ve watched with a heavy heart as my deepest suspicions about this war’s conception have been confirmed and exacerbated in its disastrous implementation.
We have been assured that the insurgency is in its last throes.
We have been told that progress is just around the corner, and that when the Iraqis stand up, we will be able to stand down.
Senators, Republican and Democrat, including myself, had also voted in favor of a resolution demanding that 2006 be a year of significant transition in Iraq.
What we have seen instead is a year of significant deterioration.
A year in which well-respected Republicans like John Warner, former Administration officials like Colin Powell, generals who have served in Iraq, and intelligence experts have all said that what we are doing is not working.
Sectarian violence has reached an all-time high, and 365,000 Iraqis have fled their homes since the bombing of a Shia mosque in Samarra last February.
300,000 Iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet American troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier.
The addition of 4,000 American troops in Baghdad has not succeeded in securing that increasingly perilous city.
In just the past three weeks, he has ?
“rejected the notion of an American ‘timeline’ for action on urgent Iraqi political issues; ordered American commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped American soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the Americans for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.”
This is now the reality of Iraq.
The American people have been extraordinarily resolved.
They have seen their sons and daughters killed or wounded in the streets of Fallujah.
They have spent hundreds of billions of their hard-earned dollars on this effort ?
money that could have been devoted to strengthening our homeland security and our competitive standing as a nation.
No, it has not been a failure of resolve that has led us to this chaos, but a failure of strategy ?
And, while some have proposed escalating this war by adding thousands of more troops, there is little reason to believe that this will achieve these results either.
They have battled insurgents, secured cities, and maintained some semblance of order in Iraq.
But even as they have carried out their responsibilities with excellence and valor, they have also told me that there is no military solution to this war.
I have long said that the only solution in Iraq is a political one.
Our best hope for success is to use the tools we have ?
The first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the Iraqi government ?
When I first advocated steps along these lines over a year ago, I had hoped that this phased redeployment could begin by the end of 2006.
This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.
Perhaps most importantly, some of these troops could be redeployed to Afghanistan, where our lack of focus and commitment of resources has led to an increasing deterioration of the security situation there.
The President’s decision to go to war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.
The security forces have to be far more inclusive ?
So far, Congress has given the Administration unprecedented flexibility in determining how to spend more than $20 billion dollars in Iraq.
But instead of effectively targeting this aid, we have seen some of the largest waste, fraud, and abuse of foreign aid in American history.
Today, the Iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi people or stabilize the country.
Finally, we have to realize that the entire Middle East has an enormous stake in the outcome of Iraq, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution.
But neither Iran nor Syria want to see a security vacuum in Iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ?
As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about America’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism.
Many who supported the original decision to go to war in Iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.
But I have long believed it has also been a failure of conception ?
In the past, it has been movements for freedom from within tyrannical regimes that have led to flourishing democracies; movements that continue today.
Much has been written about how the military invasion of Iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell.
threats we haven’t paid nearly enough attention to because we have been distracted in Iraq.
The overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in Iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world.
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs recently said that if a conflict arose in North Korea, we’d have to largely rely on the Navy and Air Force to take care of it, since the Army and Marines are engaged elsewhere.
In my travels to Africa, I have seen weak governments and broken societies that can be exploited by al Qaeda.
And on a trip to the former Soviet Union, I have seen the biological and nuclear weapons terrorists could easily steal while the world looks the other way.
There is one other place where our mistakes in Iraq have cost us dearly ?
But to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in Iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ?
I refuse to accept the possibility that I will have to come back a year from now and say the same thing.
There have been too many speeches.
There have been too many excuses.
There have been too many flag-draped coffins, and there have been too many heartbroken families.
